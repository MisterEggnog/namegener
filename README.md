# namegener
The current status of this program is incomplete.
While the program does merge names, it currently does not find the anagrams
making this effectively useless.
Furthermore, as of 07/08/2021, order is not randomized, meaning that this
program (effectively) always has the same output.
For this program to truly be useful it will need to have the anagram system
work & I'm uncertain if this will be feasible.
